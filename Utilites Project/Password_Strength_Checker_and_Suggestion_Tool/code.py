 Challenge: Password Strength Checker & Suggestion Tool

Build a Python script that checks the strength of a password based on:
1. Length (at least 8 characters)
2. At least one uppercase letter
3. At least one lowercase letter
4. At least one digit
5. At least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)

Your program should:
- Ask the user to input a password.
- Tell them what's missing if it's weak.
- If the password is strong, confirm it.
- Suggest a strong random password if the input is weak.

Bonus:
- Hide password input using `getpass` (no echo on screen).
